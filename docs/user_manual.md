Key Insights
Here are some insights that would be great to have
Number of calls 
Number of calls by week
Number and % of calls by reciever
Number and % of calls by sentiment
Length of calls (based on word count) Average, Max and Min
Length of call by call receiver
Length of call by sentiment
Call receiver by sentiment
Calls by week by sentiment
Calls by person making the call
Sentiment by person making the call
Politeness of the call receiver (for example if the reciever used “thanks” at the end of the conversation)


# Here is the business value from some of the metrics.
Productivity of call center employee - based on number of calls by employee
Call employee effectiveness - based on call sentiment by employee and length of call
Caller Satisfaction- based on sentiment of calls by callers
Anomalous Call Center activity - based on unusual spikes or dips in calls by week
Overall Satisfaction of call center - based on the number of calls with positive sentiment
Drivers of dissatisfaction - based on a deep dive into calls with negative sentiment 
It will be great if there are other areas of insight that can add business value that you can think of.

This is just a preliminary list
We can keep adding more metrics to the analyses based on this data.  Those metrics are from a call center perspective.  
Some other metrics that I can think of that could be valuable to the doctor’s office are as follows:
“Time for scheduling an appointment” insights  - Average time to schedule an appointment, average time by call center employee, average time by caller.
Time of call insights - Time of day when max and min calls happens, Day of the week when max and min calls happen 
Satisfaction Insights - Tracking Sentiment of calls in the week, Politeness of callers
Type of Call Insights - insights based on whether it is a scheduling call or some other type of call.
