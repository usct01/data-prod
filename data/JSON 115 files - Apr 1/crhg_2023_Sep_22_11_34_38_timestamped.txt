[00:00 - 00:03] Good morning. Thanks for calling Cross and Family Practice. How may I assist you today?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[00:04 - 00:05] Morning. I'd like to make a payment.

Receiver - kumar
[00:07 - 00:10] One moment. Let me transfer you to Francis. Can they help you out with this?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[00:12 - 00:13] I'm sorry?

Receiver - kumar
[00:13 - 00:17] Let me transfer you to Francis. Can they help you out with this? One moment.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[00:18 - 00:18] Okay.

Receiver - kumar
[00:26 - 00:28] Your conversation is being recorded.

Receiver - Kumar
[00:30 - 00:31] Good morning, Cross and Family Practice.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[00:31 - 00:34] Good morning. I'd like to make a payment.

Receiver - Kumar
[00:35 - 00:56] Okay. Hold on just one moment. Okay, sir. Your name?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[00:57 - 00:57] Douglas Thomas.

Receiver - Kumar
[01:01 - 01:02] Okay. And the amount?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[01:04 - 01:09] I was hoping you could tell me that. I think it's $48, but I want to make sure I pay it all. All right. Okay. Let me check here.

Receiver - Kumar
[01:09 - 01:25] No. Doesn't look like you owe anything.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[01:27 - 01:30] Huh. I keep getting notices saying I'm late and I need to pay it.

Receiver - Kumar
[01:31 - 01:37] It's your date of birth. Let me see here. You're 54 years old?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[01:38 - 01:41] Yes. April 13th, 1969. Mm-hmm.

Receiver - Kumar
[01:42 - 01:46] Well, that's odd. It says zero balance. Are you sure it's coming from us?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[01:46 - 01:55] Yeah. Yeah. It says Cross and Family. Yeah. It says for visits. They got me like plus 60 days past due, and I'm like, oh, surprise.

Receiver - Kumar
[01:55 - 01:59] No, no. No. Definitely zero balance in here.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[02:01 - 02:06] Okay. What should I do? I mean, should I bring the notice to you guys, or who should I call?

Receiver - Kumar
[02:06 - 02:10] I would just ignore the bill. How many times have you got it?

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[02:10 - 02:11] Twice.

Receiver - Kumar
[02:11 - 02:17] When did you pay your last time? See, TRICARE paid. Maybe that was the problem. TRICARE maybe hadn't paid.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[02:18 - 02:26] I pay every time I go in there. Like, when I have a visit, I pay the co-pay right there. So, huh. Okay.

Receiver - Kumar
[02:27 - 02:30] I don't see any of your payments. I see TRICARE.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[02:32 - 02:35] Could that be it? I mean, I don't know.

Receiver - Kumar
[02:36 - 02:42] Okay. You made a payment on August 14th of $24. That's the only one I see, you know, paid by you.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[02:44 - 02:47] Yeah. But they're saying I owe $48.

Receiver - Kumar
[02:50 - 02:52] Well, if you do, it's not showing up here.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[02:54 - 02:57] Okay. Yeah. I'm getting a statement I get from...

Receiver - Kumar
[02:57 - 03:00] And now, yeah, January 23rd, you paid $22.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[03:02 - 03:11] Yeah. That was the co-pay there. Mm-hmm. I don't know what to do. Okay. I hate just letting it fly out there, but okay.

Receiver - Kumar
[03:11 - 03:18] I know. If you get another one, you know, just bring it in. You know, I don't know what else to tell you because it says zero balance.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[03:19 - 03:22] Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just hate to go to collections over at something.

Receiver - Kumar
[03:22 - 03:25] Oh, you're not. We don't do collections, so don't worry about it.

Caller - Douglas Thomas
[03:26 - 03:31] Okay. All right. If I get another one, I'll bring it up there. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
