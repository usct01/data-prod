Receiver - Kathy
[00:03 - 00:07] Good morning. Thank you for calling Crofton Family Practice. This is Kathy. How may I assist you today?

Caller - Thomson
[00:08 - 00:12] Yes. I'd like to schedule an appointment and also pay a bill.

Receiver - Kathy
[00:14 - 00:17] Okay. Kindly give me a minute. So you would like to make an appointment, am I correct?

Caller - Thomson
[00:18 - 00:18] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[00:20 - 00:23] Kindly stay online. Would you like to visit the doctor in person or through tele-visit?

Caller - Thomson
[00:24 - 00:25] In person.

Receiver - Kathy
[00:26 - 00:28] In person. Yeah. Kindly stay online.

Caller - Thomson
[00:39 - 00:51] I had cereal, so. You can either do that or go to Panera's or whatever. Don't move anything on my desk.

Receiver - Kathy
[00:51 - 00:57] We do have a slot available on October 10 at 11 a.m. Will that be okay with you?

Caller - Thomson
[00:59 - 01:02] Okay. And that's for a physical, a complete physical.

Receiver - Kathy
[01:04 - 01:07] October 10 at 11 a.m. and it's on Tuesday.

Caller - Thomson
[01:12 - 01:15] Yeah. And that can be for a complete physical.

Receiver - Kathy
[01:17 - 01:22] So you would like to make an appointment for a physical? Yeah. Is this for a physical appointment?

Caller - Thomson
[01:23 - 01:23] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[01:24 - 01:34] Yeah. Kindly stay online. Could you please help me with the date of birth?

Caller - Thomson
[01:36 - 01:42] Okay. It's for my husband. Let's see. July. July. July 30th, 1938.

Receiver - Kathy
[01:56 - 01:57] Is your first name Thomas?

Caller - Thomson
[01:58 - 01:59] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[02:00 - 02:04] Yeah. I got you. Kindly give me a moment.
[02:22 - 02:31] So you have already made a physical appointment on February 10? Yes. So you just have to wait for next February to make another physical appointment?

Caller - Thomson
[02:34 - 02:36] I didn't understand what you said. Say it again.

Receiver - Kathy
[02:37 - 02:48] You have made your last physical appointment on February 13, 2023. So you just have to wait for five months.
[02:48 - 02:51] That is next February to make another appointment.

Caller - Thomson
[02:52 - 03:03] Oh, I see what you mean. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. The only reason I was saying that, maybe it's not a complete physical. Doctor, my husband keeps getting a urinary infection,
[03:03 - 03:15] and she wanted to check and make sure everything else was okay, try to figure out why he was. So maybe, I don't know. I don't know what he means.

Receiver - Kathy
[03:18 - 03:23] So you would like to make an appointment for this reason, that is urinary infection?

Caller - Thomson
[03:25 - 03:28] Right. She said that she wanted to check him,

Receiver - Kathy
[03:28 - 03:40] check him. So would you like to make an appointment for him?

Caller - Thomson
[03:42 - 03:42] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[03:43 - 03:48] Is this a physical or is this going to be a physical appointment?

Caller - Thomson
[03:49 - 03:53] Well, you said he can't have a physical, right, until February?

Receiver - Kathy
[03:55 - 03:59] Yes, you have to just wait for the next February to make the physical appointment.

Caller - Thomson
[04:00 - 04:06] Okay. Well, I don't know what she wanted then. So let's see. Okay. Yeah.
[04:08 - 04:14] Some blood work done to check his B vitamin, B level.

Receiver - Kathy
[04:17 - 04:18] Would you like to give the blood test?

Caller - Thomson
[04:19 - 04:22] Yeah, I guess that's what he just needs at this point.

Receiver - Kathy
[04:24 - 04:26] Would you like to make an appointment for the blood work?

Caller - Thomson
[04:26 - 04:27] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[04:28 - 04:29] Yeah, kindly stay online.
[04:38 - 04:41] Would you like to give the blood draw, or this is going to be a follow-up appointment?

Caller - Thomson
[04:45 - 04:53] He needs to have his blood drawn, yes. Okay. So can he just come in and do that? I guess he doesn't need an appointment, really.

Receiver - Kathy
[04:55 - 04:56] Yeah, kindly give me a minute.
[05:02 - 05:09] We do have a slot available on 27th of September at 1015 a.m. Will that be okay with you?

Caller - Thomson
[05:10 - 05:10] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[05:10 - 05:12] And it's on coming Wednesday?

Caller - Thomson
[05:13 - 05:14] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[05:15 - 05:16] Yeah, kindly stay online.
[05:34 - 05:40] So just to confirm, I have fixed an appointment on 27th of September at 1015 a.m.

Caller - Thomson
[05:43 - 05:43] Yes.

Receiver - Kathy
[05:44 - 05:50] The reason is going to be blood draw. Am I correct? Yes. Is there anything else that I may assist you with?

Caller - Thomson
[05:51 - 05:52] That's it.

Receiver - Kathy
[05:54 - 05:56] Is there anything else that I may assist you with?

Caller - Thomson
[05:57 - 05:59] I'm sorry, what's the question?

Receiver - Kathy
[05:59 - 06:03] Is there anything else that I may assist you with?

Caller - Thomson
[06:03 - 06:04] No, that's it.
