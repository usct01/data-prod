Receiver - nurse
[00:58 - 01:03] Hello, you have reached the nurse line. If this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 9-1-1.
[01:03 - 01:14] If you're calling for a prescription refill, please leave a detailed message with the drug name, the milligrams, and your pharmacy information.

Caller - Joanna Gavigan
[01:24 - 01:37] This is Joanna Gavigan. My phone number is 410-987-1857.
[01:37 - 01:49] And the reason I'm calling is because I'm totally upset with my CVS pharmacy and I want my prescriptions to go to the mail order.
[01:49 - 01:59] And what I want to do is give you the names. And they're just getting close to needing to be refilled.
[01:59 - 02:10] And CVS will fill them ahead of time and call me before I can get them to the mail order. So I'm trying to beat them to the punch.
[02:11 - 02:14] So I'd appreciate you calling me when you have a chance.
[02:29 - 02:30] 1857.
