Caller - Osazi Murray
[01:11 - 01:16] I prefer telling a visit, but I'll do what she thinks is best.

Speaker D
[01:18 - 01:21] Well, it's up to you. I mean, you're just getting your report, so it's not like.

[02:09 - 02:10] All right.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[02:10 - 02:15] The other thing is, she was doing paperwork for me for my military medical form. Is that finished?

Speaker D
[02:16 - 02:21] I have no idea. I have no idea. I'd have to ask the nurse. Hold on just a moment. Could you?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[02:22 - 02:22] Yeah. Thank you.

Speaker D
[02:53 - 02:55] When is your date of birth, Mr. Murray?

Speaker D
[03:00 - 03:05] Okay. Oh, is your first name H-A-D-I-Z-A?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[03:06 - 03:11] No, no, no. That's my wife. I'm 0-1-19-1979. She's 0-1-0-1-19.

Speaker D
[03:11 - 03:16] So, what is your first name? I'm sorry. It's been so busy here. I'm sorry to ask.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[03:16 - 03:19] O-S-A-Z-E. O-S-A-Z-E.

Speaker D
[03:21 - 03:28] Okay. There it is. All right. Did you bring a military paper in, or?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[03:29 - 03:31] Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm. Okay.

Other speaker
[03:35 - 03:35] Hmm.

Speaker D
[03:38 - 03:40] I'll have to, you know, check the house.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[03:40 - 03:48] She filled out most of it when I was there. Well. But she was waiting on my blood work to fill out the rest.

Speaker D
[03:49 - 03:50] She was waiting on what?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[03:51 - 03:58] My blood work to fill out the rest. Oh, okay. So, Amy did most of it, and then she saw me, and then she was waiting on my blood work

Speaker D
[03:58 - 03:59] to fill out the rest.

Speaker A
[03:59 - 03:59] All right. Okay.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[03:59 - 04:01] My blood work couldn't happen until Monday.

Speaker D
[04:01 - 04:05] Okay. Hold on, and let me let you talk to Amy. I have no idea. Can you hold on?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[04:06 - 04:07] Thank you. Mm-hmm.

Receiver - kumar
[05:01 - 05:03] Your conversation is being recorded.

Speaker A
[05:03 - 05:05] Hi, this is Nurse Amy. How can I help you?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[05:06 - 05:14] Hi, Amy. This is Osazi Murray. I came last week. I think it was last Thursday to do my medical form for the military.

Speaker A
[05:14 - 05:15] Yes. Yes.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[05:15 - 05:19] And Dr. Williams did most of it, and then the only thing she was waiting on was my blood work.

Speaker A
[05:20 - 05:20] Yeah.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[05:20 - 05:23] So, I did my blood work Monday. Yeah.

Speaker A
[05:23 - 05:35] So, your cholesterol is off the charts. Okay. So, if she puts those numbers on there, the military is not going to be able to do that. I'm very happy with that. So, she has to see you first. So, she's not done with the form yet.
[05:35 - 05:48] She wants to go over your labs. Okay. I think everything else on your labs look good, but your cholesterol medications are pretty, pretty elevated. So, she's probably going to have to start you on some cholesterol medications to get those values down.
[05:49 - 05:53] But that's why she wants to do that appointment. So, yeah, that form's not quite ready yet.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[05:54 - 06:00] Okay. And then, did you all get the forms from rehab for my knee? Did I? Did you get a request?

Speaker A
[06:01 - 06:08] Yes. Yes, we did. Yes. So, that was put in your chart. Yes, Dr. Williams did. We did get the request from that because it was quite a bit of pages. They did send that over.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[06:09 - 06:13] Okay. So, she'll probably do that as well when we meet?

Speaker A
[06:14 - 06:15] Yes. So, that's your next appointment.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[06:15 - 06:25] It's a write-up to extend my physical fitness test because I can't really do everything. They told me to come back in. Sure.

Speaker A
[06:26 - 06:30] Yeah. So, that should be good. As long as she's got all the paperwork, were you able to get, did Betty get you an appointment?

Caller - Osazi Murray
[06:31 - 06:34] Yeah, they just gave me one for the 3rd, October 3rd. Okay.

Other speaker
[06:34 - 06:34] Yeah.

Speaker A
[06:34 - 06:37] So, she should be able to get all that done then.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[06:38 - 06:41] Okay. If something opens up sooner, I'll take it.

Other speaker
[06:41 - 06:41] Okay.

Speaker A
[06:41 - 06:48] Yeah, we can put you on a wait list, okay? All right. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. Bye-bye.

Caller - Osazi Murray
[06:48 - 06:49] All right.

Other speaker
[06:49 - 06:49] Bye-bye.
