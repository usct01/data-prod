[00:00 - 00:03] Good morning. Thanks for calling Crawford Family Practice. How may I assist you today?

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[00:04 - 00:10] Yes, I got a call from Amy to schedule a tele-visit on the results of my blood test.

Receiver - kumar
[00:12 - 00:15] Okay, wonderful. Let me check on the next available slot for you.
[00:25 - 00:31] We do have a slot available on 5th of October at 3.45pm. Would that be okay with you for a tele-visit?

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[00:34 - 00:36] The 5th of October.

Receiver - kumar
[00:38 - 00:39] Yes, correct. It's Thursday.

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[00:39 - 00:51] Thursday? That's the soonest one available, huh? Yes, correct. For tele-visit, that's the earliest slot available. Okay, that's fine. What time?

Receiver - kumar
[00:52 - 01:01] At 3.45pm. Because we don't make any tele-visit in the morning. So that's fine. Would you like to make it?

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[01:03 - 01:09] Yeah, and I also want to see if you'll send me a copy or how I can get a copy of my test results.

Receiver - kumar
[01:10 - 01:20] Yeah, for the further details, I can transfer you to Francesca and they could help you out with this after making the appointment. So now, could you help me with your date of birth, please?

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[01:22 - 01:24] April 18th, 1958.

Receiver - kumar
[01:26 - 01:29] Your name is Irene Langwell, am I correct?

Receiver - Kumar
[01:31 - 01:31] That's correct.

Receiver - kumar
[01:32 - 01:41] So just to confirm, I have fixed an appointment on 5th of October at 3.45pm for a tele-visit.

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[01:42 - 01:43] That is correct.

Receiver - kumar
[01:44 - 01:49] Is there anything else that they meant? Oh, yeah. So now, I will transfer you to Francesca and they could help you out with this.

Caller - Ms. Langwell
[01:50 - 01:50] Thank you.
