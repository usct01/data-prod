[00:27 - 00:27] Okay, thanks.

[00:31 - 00:39] Your conversation is being recorded. Thank you for contacting Glosson Family Practice. This is Brandy here in the front office. How can we help you today?

caller - Penny Bright
[00:41 - 00:47] Hey, Brandy. It's Penny with GSK. I'm doing a lunch today, meant to be, so I'm just confirming.

receiver - brandy
[00:47 - 00:52] Oh, yes, ma'am, Miss Penny. Well, thank you so very much. We're definitely excited to have you come in.

caller - Penny Bright
[00:53 - 00:59] Cool. So I was going to pick sandwiches or salads up from Nook's. So do you want to do like you did the last time?
[01:00 - 01:07] Last time, I believe somebody texted me from the office or emailed me with your order, and I'll pick up around about 11.

receiver - brandy
[01:08 - 01:15] Yeah, no problem. Do you want me to go ahead and send it to you, or would you like me to actually call Nook's and place it for you?

Other speaker
[01:16 - 01:17] Ooh.

caller - Penny Bright
[01:17 - 01:25] Yeah. You can place it with Nook's, and then if you just do a chicken salad sandwich for me.

receiver - brandy
[01:25 - 01:35] Yeah, let me just write a little note here real quick. Bear with me just one moment here. So let me just say, it'll be, so you wanted a chicken salad sandwich with any toppings on it?

caller - Penny Bright
[01:36 - 01:38] I just, I think, I just take it the way it comes.

receiver - brandy
[01:39 - 01:43] All righty. No problem, sweetie. So I have the chicken salad sandwich, and it is Penny, right?

caller - Penny Bright
[01:44 - 01:44] Yeah.

receiver - brandy
[01:45 - 01:55] Okay. I got you listed on there, and let me just put a big note on here that we're going to do it for Nook's. Dr. Williams will be so very happy. She loves Nook's.

caller - Penny Bright
[01:56 - 02:01] She was actually the one that introduced me to that. I've never had a sandwich. When would you know? I'm like, oh, I'm going to get that.

receiver - brandy
[02:01 - 02:05] Now you're hooked on it, right? Girl, I tell you what, they got some good ones there.

caller - Penny Bright
[02:06 - 02:08] Me too. So what time do you want me to pick it up at?

receiver - brandy
[02:09 - 02:23] Well, we go to lunch at 1230, so I mean, it all depends on what time you feel. I don't think Nook's is too far away, but again, you know, that's kind of more or less like up to you, I guess you could say, of when you'd actually like to pick up.

caller - Penny Bright
[02:23 - 02:27] Yeah, just schedule it for like maybe 1145.

receiver - brandy
[02:28 - 02:38] Okay, perfect. Go ahead and is there a limit for everybody on as far as like a money of ordering or anything, or are we allowed to kind of get what we want?

caller - Penny Bright
[02:39 - 02:44] You just get what you want. It's kind of around about 20, 22 bucks.

receiver - brandy
[02:44 - 02:55] 22? Yes, ma'am. Right. I kind of figured that it would be right around there, so no problem whatsoever. I will go ahead and I will get everybody's order, of course, and then from then on, we'll be good to go, sweet thing.

caller - Penny Bright
[02:56 - 02:59] Okay, and then the only other thing I need is if you can maybe.
[03:07 - 03:10] Okay, brilliant. So 1145, I'll pick it up.

receiver - brandy
[03:10 - 03:22] No problem, sweetie, and then we'll see you at 1230. Good morning, ladies. All right, brilliant. Thank you. Thank you, Penny. Glad you got the call this morning. Have a good day. Good morning, Ms. Dahl. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.
