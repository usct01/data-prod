I have an appointment with Dr. Allison Williams at 1030.\nI went to go outside to get in my car, and I have a flat tire. So, unfortunately, I am not going to be able to make it.\nBut is there any way that I could get in sometime later today or just like as soon as the available appointment?\nBecause I have somebody coming to fix it. Luckily, it happened at the house.",
      "ReceiverContent": "Okay. I'm really sorry, my mom. The slots are already booked today. So, for the further information, let me transfer the call to a friend desk. They'll help you out with this. If the call is not answered, I'm going to leave a voice message, and they'll get back to you as soon as possible.",
