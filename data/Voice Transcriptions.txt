Good morning. Thank you for calling Croft and family practice. This is Kumar. How may I assist you today? 

Good morning. My name is Marlene Delaney and I had left a message for Brandy yesterday and she never returned my phone call. But I had asked for some paperwork that I had left in the office Wednesday when I had a appointment with Dr. Williams. And I wanted to pick it up this morning, but I have an emergency and I want to see if I can pick it up around 01:00 today. 

Sure. For paperwork, I can transfer you to Brandy and she could help you out with this. 

Repeat that again. I'm driving. I can't hear you very well. 

Okay, can you hear me now, clearly? 

Yes. 

Yes. For paperwork, I can transfer you to Brandy and she could help you out with this. 

Okay. 

All right. 

Kindly stay online. Apart from this, is there anything else that I may assist you with? 

No, I just need to know about the paperwork. I need to know if I can. 

Pick the paperwork up. Okay. 

Kindly stay online. I'm going to transfer your call. And you have a great day. 

You do the same. 

Thank you so much. 

Thank you. Bye bye.

Good morning, Brandy. This is Marlene Delaney. I was calling because I left a message for you yesterday and I had wanted to pick the paperwork up that I left, that I forgot and left in Dr. Williams office to be picked up this morning. But I have a family emergency and I'm calling to see would it be okay if I could pick that paperwork up sometime this afternoon around one or 02:00 if it's any way possible? And it was my lab work that I had bought in and you all had made a copy out of. And Dr. Williams had given me a name of an endocrinologist and I thought I had picked it up, but I picked up something that I already had in my hand and I need to know if I can come and pick the paper for the endocrinologist and that lab paperwork back up today. I really appreciate it. If you could get back with me. My number is 3015-2360 116. And it's Friday around nine five. 

Thanks. Bye. 
Good morning, thanks for calling her often family practice. This is Kumar, how may I assist you today? 

Good morning, it's Bob Dart calling for my wife Penny Dart. She developed upper respiratory symptoms yesterday and tested positive for COVID this morning. Is that something Dr. Williams can do a telehealth visit for or what do you usually recommend for something to see if she can get a prescription for Paxlevid? 

Sure, one moment. For televisit you have to wait for more than 20 days. So for covid I can translate you to the nurse and she could help you out. But if it is necessary to make up an appointment, just tell her to transfer the call to myself, then I can make an appointment. 

sure date everyone online tomorrow 

Bye bye. Thanks. 

how can I help you? 

Good morning, it's Bob Dard calling from my work Penalipedort. She has patients after Williams. She developed some upper respiratory symptoms yesterday, cough, congestion, sneezing, and I tested her for COVID this morning and the home test was positive. 

No, oh, OK. 

She has oxygen saturation is averaging about 94. She sort of crunched down in bed. That might have an impact. Temperature is 99 .6. She's not short of breath, but I'm just wondering if she needs a telehealth visit to get prescription for Paxlavid. 

I think her rheumatologist thought it would probably be a good idea to get her started on that. 

Okay, and she's not on any kind of blood dinner, is she? 

Cheers, Mark. 

Okay, all right, so yeah, we could just do a quick little nurse visit here with me and you and you kind of give me all the information I needed so there's no really need to see doctor. We're just telling people to use over -the -counter stuff for the coughing congestion. 

She can have anything like that and then the Paxilavoid will go ahead and get that called in to the pharmacy for her. Oh, great. Yeah, so yeah, Dr. Williams will agree with that. So, all right, and you said her oxygen and I know for, you know, the oxygen level gets too low, you know, you know, to take her to ER and all that. 

Okay, all right, so oh gosh, well I hope she feels better. I will get this, I'll get that antiviral called in. Where would you like for me to call it into? 

CVS in Odenton, Naples Road. 

Alright, I'll get this called in for her and I hope she feels better and hopefully you don't get it. 

I tested my, I have a little bit of a scratchy throat. I tested myself just a little while ago. It's amazing. Why don't I go ahead and... 

I'll go with the weekend coming. Why don't I go ahead and call in one for you as well, just to have it on the end? Does that sound like a good, I think that would be kind of smart to have that way because, you know, the quicker you test positive, the quicker you get it started. 

It works better if you start it within that first 24 hours you're tested positive. So I'll go ahead and call you. Because you're a patient here too, right? 

Oh yeah, yes, I'll have to. Yes, yes, yes. 

All right, so I'm going to go ahead and get both of these called in for both of you. OK, I appreciate it. Of course, hers start right away, and yours just here in case you need it, OK? And I hope she feels better. 

I thank you very much and I'll test, I'll see how my symptoms go. I might test again later. It's just very subtle, maybe nothing. 

Yeah, and this strand doesn't seem to be as bad as it was in the very beginning, so hopefully she'll be quickly healing here. All right, I will get those both called in for you guys, okay? And feel better. 

Thank you so much. You're very welcome. 

very welcome. Bye bye. 

Thank you. You're welcome. 
Good morning. Thank you for calling Croft and family practice. This is Kumar. How may I assist you today? 

Yes, I need to talk to the front office to check on a referral. 

Okay. Yes, her name is Brandy. Apart from this, is there anything else that I may assist you with? 

Nope, that's it. Thank you. 

Okay, kindly stay online. I'm going to transfer your call to Brandy and she could help you out with this. 

Thank you. 

Kindly stay online and you have a great day. Okay, thank you. Bye bye. 

Your conversation is being recorded. 

Hi, there. Thank you for contacting Croft and family practice. This is Brandy in the front office. How can we help you today? 

Yes, Brandy, you had sent me a template to do the Tricare referral, and I had sent it back to you earlier this week, and I just wanted to make sure you have all the information to send the referral out to Tricare. 

What's your name, ma'am? 

Rosa Maria Smith. 

Yes, ma'am. Ms. Smith, I actually did get it. I just haven't had a chance to do your referral. And I do. Actually, our nurse was out for the past two days, unfortunately. So I was kind of covering bits and pieces of not only the office, but then doing other medical things. So I'm very sorry a little. For the little bit of a backup. I will try to get it done today and make sure that I get it in. But I did definitely get your email. I've already actually printed it out and I have it with a blank referral form ready for me to put in the information. 

Okay. So some of the information I didn't have, like the tax id of the doctor and that stuff, is that stuff you fill out? 

No. Well, so actually, like, the NPI number and such, you usually can go right online and either look it up or you can give the doctor's office a call. If you don't happen to have it, though, what I'll do is I'll just find the doctor's office online and give them a call and see if I can get it. Sometimes they don't feel comfortable giving it out to a patient. Sometimes they do it all, you know, either. Which way, though, I'll do my best and I'll get the information that needs to be on there as well. 

Okay. Thank you. 

My pleasure, Ms. Smith. Thank you for calling in for the update. 

Bye bye.
