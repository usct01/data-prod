We weren't sure if Nurse Amy was going to be in today. So at any rate, you can call me back at 410-960-3826 or 987-5737. And that's a 410 area code. Sorry, I forgot that. Anyway, if somebody could call and let me know if he can come in and get his testosterone shot this morning or sometime today, I would appreciate it. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
